# R Markdown File to Explore White Wine Dataset

This project is created for Project 2 (Term 2) of Udacity's Data Analyst
Nanodegree (DAND). In this project, which is written in R Markdown (.Rmd)
format, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing
information of nearly 5000 white wines, including their chemical properties and
quality ratings. Through this EDA, I explored the variables, structure,
patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of the dataset to find out
properties of the wines that are correlated to their quality ratings.
